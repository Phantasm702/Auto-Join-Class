## Ever been late to class?
With this script, never worry about that again. 

With a simple keybind, you can retrieve the link to join the respective class, and put it in the browser.

### To-Do:
1) Implement 'execute on shortcut' on windows using pynput.  
2) Send push notifications when joining class, with the class name so that the user can make sure they're joining the right class.  
3) Implement 'remind when class is starting' feature.
